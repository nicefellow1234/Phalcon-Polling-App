# Phalcon Polling App
A simple app created in BootStrap with help of using Phalcon Framework for basic idea to learn that how easy it is to create a CRUD App in Phalcon.

# Important Notes :
**REMEMBER :** Before doing anything make sure that you already installed Phalcon Framework or otherwise the project wouldn't work.
**NOTE 1 :** Remember to import the Database Backup file namely as `polling-app-db-backup.sql` to your Database.
**NOTE 2 :** Remember to update your `setSchema("phalcon");` to your `setSchema("db-name");` in your model files if you were to get table not found errors.

After that navigate to http://yourhost/yourprojectfolder/poll

And you will be set.
