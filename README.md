A simple app created in BootStrap with help of using Phalcon Framework for basic idea to learn that how easy it is to create a CRUD App in Phalcon.

**REMEMBER :** Before doing anything make sure that you already installed Phalcon Framework or otherwise the project wouldn't work.

**NOTE :** Remember to import the Database Backup file namely as `polling-app-db-backup.sql` to your Database.
